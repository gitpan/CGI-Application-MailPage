Revision history for Perl extension CGI::Application::MailPage.

1.3 (Oct 11, 2004)
        - Added 'acceptable_domains' param to restrict the domain
            of the page to mail (protection against spam)
        - Added 'remote_fetch' param to allow sending pages that
            aren't on local filesystem
        - Added 'extra_tmpl_params' param to further customize the
            processing of the templates.
        - Added 'format_options' tmpl_var that is available to the
            'form_template' to use instead of 'format_selector' if you
            want more control.
        - All templates now have 'die_on_bad_params' = 0 so that you aren't
            required to have all tmpl_params/tmpl_loops present in your
            templates
